                            <p> <h2> Dear Students,</h2><br>
                                on this short website there is the opportunity to share materials and help us orgaize the tutorials.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You will find all the organisational instructions from Prof. Dr. Matthias Bartelmann in the <a class="intext" href="https://uebungen.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/vorlesung/20242/1932">Uebungen system</a> </li>
                                    <li>We meet on Mondays at INF 227 in room 03.404 from 11:15 to 13:00.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Suggest questions you would like to focus on in the tutorials!</h2>
                            <p> Under this <a class="intext" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XIyVWemE3WAvHCdeMGRckLvYpkvhZGLgTUNiJVhYZwY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">LINK</a> you will find a google document,
                                here you can suggest questions to cover in the next tutorial.
                               <li>You can do so anonymously or if you consider it useful you can also sign them.</li> 
                               <li>Please, try to always submit your questions by Thursday’s lunchtime.</li>
                               <li>I cannot promise that we will manage to get through all of them but it will definitely serve us as a guide.</li>
                               <li>I do not limit the format in any way.</li>
                               <li>Please trust that no questions are inadequate.</li>
                               I will also use this document to note questions that come up in the tutorial before, 
                               in case we want to return to them next week. 
                               You can also note organizational suggestions about the functioning of the tutorial in the final section.
                               The link will remain the same, but there will be a new page/section for each week.
                            </p>

                            <h2>What will we try in the upocoming sessions?</h2>
                            <p>To move forward I aim to try some of the following in the tutorial:
                               <li>Open the session with lecture's "best hits", that will be an opportunity for anyone to recap one of the core ideas of the preceding week's lecture that caught their attention.</li> 
                               <li>We will spend a significant amount of time going back over the concepts of the lecture. Especially focusing on the questions that we are trying to answer, assumptions anf the meaning of the results.</li>
                               <li>Along the way, we will  answer questions suggested by the students.</li>
                               <li>We will be thorough in motivating the problems from the exercise sheets and others.</li>
                               <li>The exercise sheet problems themselves will not be omitted, yet we will only return to the key steps.</li>
                            </p>
