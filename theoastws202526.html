                            <p> <h2> Dear Students,</h2><br>
                                on this short website there is the opportunity to share materials and help us orgaize the tutorials.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You will find all the homework sheets, lecture notes & organisational instructions from Prof. Dr. Ralf Klessen in the <a class="intext" href="https://uebungen.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/vorlesung/20252/2133">Uebungen system</a> </li>
                                    <li>We meet on Tuesdays at Philosophenweg 12 in room 056 from 9:15 to 11:00.</li>
                                    <li>We will be working in a two week cycle: after the homework problem is uploaded to the uebungen system, you will have one week to work on it (it has to be uploaded on Wednesday the following week).
                                         I will then correct your solutions and upload the corrections to the system. 
                                         The problem will then be discussed in the following tutorial.</li>
                                    <li>You need to obtain at least 60% of the total points from the HW to be admitted to the exam.</li>
                                    <li>You also have the obligation to present twice one of the exercise problems during the tutorial sessions. See below how this is organised.</li>
                                    <li>Solutions to the sheets will not be uploaded, yet they will be discussed in the tutorials.</li>
                                    <li>An attendance sheet will not be kept, yet it is  expected that you attend the tutorials most of the time.</li>
                                    <li>Please use my work email (kristian.vitovsky@h-its.org) to reach out if you have any questions. (I do not check other communication channels regularly.)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Presenting in the tutorials</h2>
                            <p> Under this <a class="intext" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FTTPYK5t9e02U5gknFOvTTmds--VoNG4BxspwQUk7TY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">LINK</a> you will find a google document,
                                here you can volunteer to present in the next tutorial and note questions you would like to discuss.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                               <li>Presenting usualy means the full exercise from the HW sheet.</li> 
                               <li>If nobody volunteers, I will pick someone without mercy.</li>
                               <li>You have to do these at least twice in the semester.</li>
                               <li>Ask questions!</li>
                               <li>At the point of presenting you will also have the corrections at hand, so please incorporate them into your presentation.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>

                            <h2>What will we try in the upcoming sessions?</h2>
                            <p>Let us start with trying the following plan:
                               <li>First 10 - 15 minutes will be open for questions about the HW sheet you will be working on in that week.</li> 
                               <li>Next, we will have a brief recap of the key concepts of the theory connect to the HW that is to be discussed that week.</li>
                               <li>The rest of the tutorials will be dedicated to the presentations of HW exercises.</li>
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
