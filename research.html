                            The binary is comprised of two B-type stars with the less massive component transferring mass onto the more massive one. 
                            In my master’s thesis, 
                            which was supervised by <a class="hidden_link" href="https://sirrah.troja.mff.cuni.cz/~mira/">doc. Brož</a> of the <a class="hidden_link" href="https://astro.mff.cuni.cz/index_en.html">Astronomical Institute of Charles University</a>, 
                            we conducted a study of the dynamics of the accretion disc.
                            Our study follows in the footsteps of  <cite><a class="hidden_link" href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/01/aa39035-20/aa39035-20.html"> [Brož et al., 2021]</a></cite>
                            who interpreted all available data in a radiation-transfer kinematic model.
                            All our models were constrained by a fixed accretion rate, that was inferred from the observed rate of change of the binary period. </p>
                           <p> <br> Firstly we modified the analytical models of steady-state
                            viscous accretion discs by <cite><a class="hidden_link" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973A%26A....24..337S/abstract"> Shakura and Sunyaev [1973]</a></cite>, which introduce the well known &alpha;-parametrisation of viscosity, 
                            for a general opacity prescription and to better fit a stellar central object,
                            $$\kappa = \kappa_0 \rho^A T^B,$$
                            and derived radial profiles of various quantities (&Sigma;, <i style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">T</i>, <i style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">H</i>).
                            We were able to greatly reduce the number of possible models by looking for incosistencies between the assupmtions under which the models were derived and the generated profiles.
                        </p>  
                        <p><br>Secondly, we computed more general models numerically.
                            We used 1-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic models, accounting for viscous, radiative as well as irradiation terms <cite>[<a class="hidden_link" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A%26AS..141..165M/abstract">Masset, 2000</a>, <a class="hidden_link" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...606A.114C/abstract">Chrenko et al., 2017</a>]</cite>.
                            Since the central object in this case is close and hot, we exoerimented with simple modifications to the code to account for radiation pressure in the disc.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The combination of analytical and numerical modeling proved fruiful, the two approaches reached a good agreenment.
                        <ul>
                            <li> The simulations achieved a steady state on the viscous timescale and generated discs with approximately Keplerian rotation, hence giving some justification to use of the analytical models. </li>                    
                            <li> The disk is still gas pressure dominated. </li>
                            <li>To reconcile temperature profiles, we have to distinguish three different temperatures: mid-plane, atmospheric and irradiation (see fig.). 
                                The latter two are comparable to observations.Our findings could indicate the presence of either vertical convection or a temperature inversion in the discs vertical atmosphere.  </li>
                            <li> The fixed accretion rate implies high densities in the disc.</li>
                            <li>The observed aspect ratio can be reached in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. 
                                This is in opposition to <cite><a class="hidden_link" href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/01/aa39035-20/aa39035-20.html"> [Brož et al., 2021]</a></cite> who who considered the disc to be vertically unstable.

                            <li>The most dominant opacity presciption is close to Krammer's (absorption on electrons in the field of ions).</li>
                            <li> Most succesful models were computed for &alpha;=0.1, which is consistent with gathered evidence for fully ionized thin accretion discs.</li>

                88 Her is a spectroscopic binary exhibiting the <a class="hidden_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_star">Be phenomenon</a>. 
                In the thesis, which was supervised by <a class="hidden_link", href="https://www.mff.cuni.cz/cs/fakulta/organizacni-struktura/lide?hdl=1171">prof.

                we collected photometric observations from 12 different sources covering a period from 1968 to 2019 
                for the purpose of studying variations on the timescale of years to decades.
                All the used data was either available in or transformed into the Johnson Standard system.

            <br>
            <p>
                We compared the photometric data to the evolution of the H&alpha; emission line in the same period (see fig.). Phormetry and spectroscopy and discussed in connection
                to possible physical models.
                <ul>
                <li>The light curve shows three long-term variation cycles that differ in strength and length. 
                    A quantitative description of each cycle is given. The cycles seem to be quasiperiodic.</li>
                <li> The star's behavior corresponds to what is described in literature as the <a class="hidden_link" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26ARv..21...69R/abstract">Negative correlation</a>. 
                     The observations are consistent with the model of a varying approximately edge-on observed disc around the star. </li>
                <li>The three cycles show a positive correlation between the depth of the minimum in luminosity, 
                    cycle length and maximum strength of hydrogen emission during the corresponding cycle. 
                    These values have an inverse correlation to the reddening of of the B-V colour index.</li>
                <li>The minimum luminosity is reached before the maximum in emission line strength.
                    Hydrogen emission first appears during the steep decreas in luminosity at the begining of the cycle and reaches it's extreme during the gradual luminosity growth.</li>
                <li>Altogether the three cycles indicate a gradual change on an even longer timescale. 
                    The decreases in luminosity are becoming deeper,

        <h2>An attempted reliable detection of spectral lines of the secondary in the binary system V1765 Cyg (student project)</h2>
        <p>
            With the help and supervision of <a class="hidden_link", href="https://www.mff.cuni.cz/cs/fakulta/organizacni-struktura/lide?hdl=1171">prof. Harmanec</a> of the <a class="hidden_link" href="https://astro.mff.cuni.cz/index_en.html">Astronomical Institute of Charles University</a>,
            I attempted a reliable detection of spectral lines of the secondary in the binary system V1765 Cyg.
            We applied Fourier disentangling <a class="hidden_link" href="https://www.asu.cas.cz/~had/OO156.pdf"><cite>[Škoda et al.,2011]</cite></a> to spectra from the Ondřejov Observatory of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and conducted
            radial velocity measurements on the disentangled spectra. We compared the obtained RV curves to the results we
            got using classical methods, firstly using the ”oscilloscopic” method of measuring radial velocities in the SPEFO
            tool <a class="hidden_link" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ASPC..101..187S/abstract"><cite>[Skoda, 1996]</cite></a> on the measured spectra and secondly comparing the measured spectra to synthetic spectra.
            The comparison showed that the disentangled spectra could not be regarded as reliable. 
            The disentangling, in this case, is complicated by a likely similar spectral type of both components and a significantly higher luminosity of the
            primary, it can also be an indication of the presence of additional complications in the system like circumstellar matter.
